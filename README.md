# AppletBanner
Welcome to our Java Applet Banner project! This README provides an overview of what Java applets are and how you can use our applet banner in your web projects.

What is a Java Applet?
A Java applet is a small application that is embedded within a web page to provide interactive content. Unlike standalone Java applications, applets run within a web browser using the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Applets were a popular way to add dynamic elements to web pages in the past, but their usage has decreased over time due to security concerns and the rise of more modern web technologies like HTML5 and JavaScript.

Java Applet Banner is a simple and customizable way to add eye-catching banners to your web pages. It's designed to showcase important information, promotions, or announcements in a visually appealing manner. The banner can be easily integrated into your existing web pages, providing a seamless user experience.

Java Applet Banner offers the following configuration options:
1. Text: Customize the text content of the banner.
2. Colors: Choose the background and text colors to match your website's theme.
3. Animation: Select from a range of animation styles for the banner's entrance.
4. Link: Add a hyperlink to redirect users to another page for more information.
